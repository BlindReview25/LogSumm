You are an expert in log analysis and summarization. Your task is to evaluate the quality of a log summary that has been generated from a log chunk.

Task Description:

This task involves assessing a summary generated from a log chunk. The summary must:
- Include only critical log events (e.g., errors, failures, system malfunctions, or potential issues)
- Exclude routine messages and redundant entries
- Enclose within <start>...</end> tags
- Return <start>normal</end> if no critical events are found
- Avoid any extra commentary or formatting outside the tags

Make sure put the required tags for scores and explanations.

Evaluation Criteria:

Evaluate the generated summary based on the following four aspects:
1. Completeness: Does the summary capture all important critical events from the log chunk, as reflected in the ground truth, while avoiding non-critical content?
2. Linguistic Features: Is the summary grammatically correct, concise, clear, and appropriate for an operations team?
3. Correct Structure: Does the summary strictly follow the required format inside <start>...</end> tags, and no extra text or formatting violations?
4. Semantic Alignment: Does the summary accurately represent the content of the log chunk, avoiding fabrication, distortion, or omission of key event details?

Scoring:
For each criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score (0–5, where 0 = completely wrong, 5 = perfect). If any input (generated summary) is missing, assign 0 for all criteria.

Now, evaluate the following summary:

Log Chunk:
```{log-chunk}```
Ground Truth Summary:
```{ground-truth}```
Generated Summary:
```{generated-summary}```

You are an expert in log analysis and summarization. Your task is to evaluate the quality of an interpretive log summary that has been generated from a log chunk.

Task Description:
This task involves assessing a generated interpretation of a log chunk. The interpretation should focus on critical events (e.g., errors, warnings, system malfunctions, performance issues, or potential risks) and their impact on system operations.
The interpretation must be:
- Concise and clearly written
- Focused only on critical content
- Fully enclosed in <start>...</end> tags
- If no critical events are found, return: <start>normal</end>

Make sure put the required tags for scores and explanations.

Evaluation Criteria:
Evaluate the generated interpretation based on the following four aspects:
1. Completeness: Does the interpretation include the most important and relevant information from the log chunk, as reflected in the ground truth?
2. Linguistic Features: Is the interpretation grammatically correct, concise, clear, and appropriate for an operations team?
3. Correct Structure: Is the interpretation enclosed in a single <start>...</end> tag, with no extra text or formatting errors outside the tag?
4. Semantic Alignment: Does the interpretation accurately represent the log chunk’s critical points without introducing false information or misinterpretations?

Scoring:
For each criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score (0–5, where 0 = completely wrong, 5 = perfect). If any input (generated interpretation) is missing, assign 0 for all criteria.

Now, evaluate the following interpretation:

Log Chunk:
```{log-chunk}```

Ground Truth interpretation:
```{ground-truth}```

Generated interpretation:
```{generated-interpretation}```

Evaluation:

1. Completeness:
Explanation:<EC></EC>
Score: <SC></SC>

2. Linguistic Features:

You are an expert in log analysis and summarization. Your task is to evaluate the quality of a structured summary generated from a log chunk. 

Task Description:

This task involves assessing a structured interpretive summary generated from a log chunk. The summary must:

- Focus only on critical log events (e.g., errors, warnings, system malfunctions, or potential issues).
- Represent each event in the following structure:
 <start>[event: <log event>] [severity: <0–5>] [root cause: <brief explanation>] [potential issues: <brief description>] [impact: <brief system impact>] [solution: <brief resolution>]</end>
- Exclude routine messages and redundant details.
- Return <start>normal</end> if there are no critical events.
- Use only one set of tags per event and no text outside the tags.

Make sure put the required tags for scores and explanations.

Evaluation Criteria:
Evaluate the generated summary based on the following four aspects:

- Completeness: Does the summary include all critical events from the log chunk as reflected in the ground truth, with proper identification of severity, cause, and impact?
- Linguistic Features: Is the summary grammatically correct, clear, concise, and written in a way that is understandable and useful for a technical operations team?
- Correct Structure: Is each critical event formatted exactly as specified (within a single <start>...</end> block, using all required fields in correct order with appropriate delimiters)? Are there no extraneous details or tags?
- Semantic Alignment: Does the summary accurately represent the log chunk’s critical events without hallucinating causes, impacts, or solutions? Are root causes, severity scores, and solutions realistically inferred from the log content?


Scoring:
For each criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score (0–5, where 0 = completely wrong, 5 = perfect). If any input (generated summary) is missing, assign 0 for all criteria.


Now, evaluate the following summary:

Log Chunk:
{log-chunk}

Ground Truth Summary:
{ground-truth}

Generated Summary:
{generated-summary}

Evaluation:

1. Completeness:

You are an expert in log analysis and summarization. Your task is to evaluate the quality of a structured log summary that includes a summary of critical events, definitions of key terms, and a brief interpretation.

Task Description:

This task involves assessing a structured summary generated from a log chunk. The summary should consist of three parts:

1. Summary: A concise list of critical log events only (e.g., errors, failures, system malfunctions, or potential issues), excluding routine or redundant messages.

2. Definitions: Clear and relevant explanations for key terms necessary to understand or troubleshoot the critical events. These may include technical components, protocols, or system mechanisms.

3. Interpretation: A concise analysis of the critical events, highlighting their potential impact on system behavior, performance, or security.

The full response must be enclosed within:

<start>
<Summary>...</Summary>
<Definitions>...</Definitions>
<Interpretation>...</Interpretation>
</end>

If no critical events are found, the correct result is:
<start>normal</end>

Make sure put the required tags for scores and explanations.

Evaluation Criteria:

Evaluate the generated summary based on the following four aspects:

1. Completeness: Does the overall response capture all critical log events from the chunk and provide adequate definitions and interpretation consistent with the ground truth?
2. Linguistic Features: Is the content grammatically correct, concise, and clear? Is the writing style appropriate for a technical operations audience?
3. Correct Structure: Is the output properly wrapped within <start>...</end>, and does it include exactly one <Summary>, <Definitions>, and <Interpretation> section in the correct order? Are all sections formatted correctly without extraneous content?
4. Semanitic Alignment: Does the summary, definitions, and interpretation accurately reflect the content of the log chunk without hallucinating causes, exaggerating impacts, or false information?

Scoring:
For each criterion, provide a brief explanation and a score (0–5, where 0 = completely wrong, 5 = perfect). If any input (generated summary) is missing, assign 0 for all criteria.

Now, evaluate the following summary:

Log Chunk:
{log-chunk}

Ground Truth Summary:
{ground-truth}

Generated Summary:
{generated-summary}
